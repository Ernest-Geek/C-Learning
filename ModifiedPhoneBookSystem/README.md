This is a simple command-line phone book application implemented in C. It allows users to add phone book entries, store them in a file, and print the phone book entries from the file.

## Features

- Add phone book entry: Users can add a new phone book entry by providing the first name, last name, and phone number.
- Print phone book: Displays all the phone book entries stored in the file.
- Error handling: Proper error handling is implemented to handle file I/O errors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Compilation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
4. Compile the code using the following command:

   ```
      gcc phone_book.c -o phone_book
         ```

	 ### Usage

	 1. Run the compiled executable:

	    ```
	       ./phone_book
	          ```

		  2. The program will display a menu with options to add a phone book entry or print the phone book.
		  3. Choose an option by entering the respective number and follow the prompts to add entries or print the phone book.

		  ### File Handling

		  The phone book entries are stored in a file named "phone_book.dat" in the same directory as the executable. The file is automatically created if it doesn't exist. New entries are appended to the end of the file.

		  ### Example

		  ```
		  Welcome to the Phone Book Application!

		  1. Add phone book entry
		  2. Print phone book

		  Select an option: 1

		  Enter first name: John
		  Enter last name: Doe
