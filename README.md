# Simple Substitution Cipher Cryptography Program

This program is a simple implementation of a substitution cipher for encryption and decryption of messages. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a randomly generated key.

## Features

- Encryption: Users can enter a word or phrase to encrypt. The program shifts the ASCII value of each character by a random key and displays the encrypted message.
- Decryption: Users can enter a cipher text to decrypt. The program reverses the encryption process by shifting each character's ASCII value back using the random key, and displays the decrypted message.
- Random Key Generation: Users can choose to generate a new random key, which will be used for subsequent encryption and decryption operations.
- Menu: The program provides a menu with options to perform encryption, decryption, generate a new key, and quit the program.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed.
2. Select the desired option:
   - Option 1: Encrypt Clear Text - Enter a word or phrase to encrypt.
   - Option 2: Decrypt Cipher Text - Enter a cipher text to decrypt.
   - Option 3: Generate New Key - Generate a new random key.
   - Option 4: Quit - Exit the program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter input and view the results.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 as needed for encryption, decryption, or generating a new key.

## Notes

- The program uses a simple substitution cipher, which is not suitable for strong encryption. It is meant for educational purposes and understanding basic cryptographic principles.
- The key generated is limited to values between 1 and 4. You can modify the code to change the range if desired.
